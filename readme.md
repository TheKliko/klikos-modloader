                    Introducing more people to Roblox mods

            This project was inspired by <a href='https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap'>Bloxstrap</a>, an open-source, alternative bootstrapper for Roblox. Bloxstrap is what introduced me to the Roblox modding community and where I learned many different ways to improve my mods. Not being able to quickly switch between custom mod profiles and set mod priorities is what led to me creating my own modloader.
